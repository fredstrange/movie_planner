Inspired by the real events of what have since been called the “The Brothel Scandal” in the late 1970’s, »Call Girl« depicts the exposure of a prostitution scandal in Sweden as seen through the eyes of a young girl named Iris, who is recruited from a juvenile home and successively works her way upwards through the prostitution business, all the way to the top politicians.

Director Mikael Marcimain aims to address this by presenting a view of the darker world, behind the curtains of everyday society. Inspired by the real events of what have since been called the “The Brothel Scandal” in the late 1970’s, »Call Girl« depicts the exposure of a prostitution scandal in Sweden as seen through the eyes of a young girl named Iris, who is recruited from a juvenile home and successively works her way upwards through the prostitution business, all the way to the top politicians. As the politicians’ facade starts to crumble and fall, desperate measures are required to maintain status quo. Soon enough the prostitution scandal becomes more of a fact than a fear, and threatens to severely tarnish people’s confidence in those in charge of the country. With a great social consciousness, director Mikael Marcimain creates a tension driven thriller of a dark Swedish political scandal, set in a perfect replica of the 1970’s.",
